      <description>What I want to get out of this experience? Some Data points of the experience Created 8 Hours of Tutorial Content on C++, OOP and Software Design My Responsiblities Normal times vs. COVID-19 A Typical Day working from home vs. working in the office Productivity Effective of Communication Always on the Clock Distractions The good, the bad and the ugly I love the weekly coffee chats!
The documentation is not well maintained, and it took a lot of effort for me to go through and update everything.</description>

      <description>Exploring Canadian Island on the East Coast It&amp;rsquo;s only feasible to travel within the province or across the Maritimes this summer considering COVID-19.
The ship is coming in!
We took some photos of us on the boat because we&amp;rsquo;re traveling as a family.
We stayed at the Marathon Inn, I always like</description>

      <description>Comparing Math Standardized Score Between Large and Small Schools in California Background The data contains the average standardized test scores of grade 5 students in each school in California in the school year of 1998 through 1999. On top of the scores, information are collected on areas such as the number of students enrolled in the school, number of computers per classroom, the percentage of students in school that qualify for a reduced price lunch, and the percentage of students whose first language is not English in the school.</description>

      <description>Anatomy of a Significance Test The Goal We want to test the difference between attributes of 2 sub-populations relative to randomly mixed sub-populations and provide numerical evidence.
The Null Hypothesis The following equivalent statements are the null hypothesis, H0 that we are testing.
H0:The sub-populations P1 and P2 were randomly draw from the same population H0:The sub-populations P1 and P2 were created randomly by assigning units in the same population to each of P1 and P2 H0:The sub-populations P1 and P2 were randomly generated.</description>

      <description>Bootstrap-t Confidence Interval We want to approximate the sampling distribution of a pivotal quantity with bootstrap distribution so that we could construct a confidence interval. The method is similar to approximating a sampling distribution of a pivotal quantity using a t-distribution.
The Step-By-Step Approach Given a sample ùíÆ, an attribute a(ùíÆ), and standard error $$\widehat {SD}[\tilde a(\mathcal S)]$$, calculate a(ùíÆ) and standard error $$\widehat {SD}[\tilde a(\mathcal S)]$$ based on the sample.</description>

Towards Smaller Diffusion Models - Gaussian Mixture Masks and UNet Scaling #Diffusion Models #Deep Learning #Research
Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated superior image generation capabilities but suffer from slow inference and high computational costs. As a first step to address these challenges, we propose two novel modifications to enhance small-scale diffusion models- Gaussian mixture masks and scaled skip connections.

      <description>Sample Sample Definitions A sample S is a subset of the population. A sample has n‚ÄÑ&amp;lt;‚ÄÑ&amp;lt;‚ÄÑN units.
An sample attribute a(ùíÆ) is an estimate of the population attribute a(ùí´)
$$ a(\mathcal S) = \widehat{a(\mathcal P)} = a(\hat{\mathcal P})$$ Sample error is the difference between the sample estimate a(ùíÆ) and the population attribute a(ùí´) (the estimand). For numerical attributes , sample error is determined mathematically. For graphical attributes, sample error is not determined precisely but it is still conceptually applicable.</description>

      <description>Influence Influence Definition Influence of a variate yu on the population attribute when a variate yu is removed from the population is measured by the following expression:
Œî(Œ±,u)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑŒ±(y1,‚ÄÜ‚Ä¶,‚ÄÜyu‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ1,‚ÄÜyu,‚ÄÜyu‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ1,‚ÄÜ‚Ä¶,‚ÄÜyN)‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖŒ±(y1,‚ÄÜ‚Ä¶,‚ÄÜyu‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ1,‚ÄÜyu‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ1,‚ÄÜ‚Ä¶,‚ÄÜyN) for each unit u in the population, and Œ± is an arbitrary population attribute. Note the first part of the equation contains the unit u, and the unit u is removed in the second part of the equation.</description>
