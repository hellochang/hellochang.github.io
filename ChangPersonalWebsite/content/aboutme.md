Hi! I'm Chang, a thesis-based Master’s student specializing in computer vision within the [Systems Design Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/) department at the University of Waterloo. I'm co-supervised by Prof. [Sirisha Rambhatla](https://sirisharambhatla.com/) and Prof. [Alexander Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wong-90650216/?originalSubdomain=ca) as part of the [Vision and Image Processing (VIP) Lab](https://vip.uwaterloo.ca/chang-liu/) and [Critical ML Lab](https://sirisharambhatla.com/criticalml/). 

My ultimate vision is to develop safe and highly capable models that effectively combine multiple modalities, including vision, language, audio, and more. My current research focuses on unsupervised image segmentation, particularly under distribution shifts, with applications in manufacturing and self-driving. This work aligns with my broader vision as I incorporate language as an additional modality to tackle the distributional shift challenge.

Prior to my Master's, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo, where I collaborated with Prof. [Stephen Watt](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~smwatt/) on classifying students' learning habits and Prof. [Sirisha Rambhatla](https://sirisharambhatla.com/) on predicting survival probabilities for patients with alcoholic liver disease.

<!-- ### Professional interests
So far, I liked every subject– they all serve a purpose and I enjoy learning about them. I just love learning haha.

In particular though, I really enjoy STEM subjects. Right now, I'm aspiring to be a professional Data Sceintist or perhaps a Software Engineer for my future career, and I've had 5+ internships in the field. -->




<!-- ### Outside of Work

I absolutely love reading! I can’t spend a day without reading at least a couple of pages of a book, no matter how busy I am.

Apart from reading, I especially like photojournalism and travel photography. I really enjoy capturing people's life in different countries and understanding various cutlures.  -->


<!-- and I always marvel at how vast, different yet similar the world can be. -->

 <!-- I’ve been to quite a few places (Ecuador, Tanzania, Greece, Israel, South Korea, to name a few). -->

<!-- to promote mutual understanding from cultures . Capture photos to show similarities and differences -->

<!-- But I recently got into portraiture and event photography, perhaps because quite a few student societies I joined needed me to cover for their event (such as 180 consulting, Women in CS, and MathSoc). -->



<!-- ![A photo that I took for the 180 Degrees Consulting Deloitte Event Workshop](../assets/img/aboutme/180_dc_deloitte_event_photo.jpg) -->



<!-- I also realized that photography is a great way to document our family life moments since I’m spending so much time away from my family in university.  -->

<!-- ![A photo of mom and sister](/assets/img/aboutme/mom_n_sis.jpg) -->

<!-- When I'm not coding or doing any of the above, you could find me sailing, kayaking, swimming, camping, hiking, skiing, skating, running, doing yoga, playing ultimate frisbee, playing basketball, playing badminton, drawing, playing clarinet, and more. I've dabbled in quite a few sports and I challenge you to find something that I haven't tried! -->
