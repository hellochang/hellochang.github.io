Hi! This is Chang. I'm a thesis-based [Master’s student](https://vip.uwaterloo.ca/chang-liu/) at the University of Waterloo. I'm co-supervised by [Prof. Sirisha Rambhatla](https://sirisharambhatla.com/) and [Prof. Alex Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wong-90650216/?originalSubdomain=ca) as part of the [Vision and Image Processing (VIP) Lab](https://vip.uwaterloo.ca/chang-liu/) and [Critical ML Lab](https://sirisharambhatla.com/criticalml/). My research focus is on unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation, with application to manufacturing, self-driving and medical imaging.

<!-- ### Professional interests
So far, I liked every subject– they all serve a purpose and I enjoy learning about them. I just love learning haha.

In particular though, I really enjoy STEM subjects. Right now, I'm aspiring to be a professional Data Sceintist or perhaps a Software Engineer for my future career, and I've had 5+ internships in the field. -->




<!-- ### Outside of Work

I absolutely love reading! I can’t spend a day without reading at least a couple of pages of a book, no matter how busy I am.

Apart from reading, I especially like photojournalism and travel photography. I really enjoy capturing people's life in different countries and understanding various cutlures.  -->


<!-- and I always marvel at how vast, different yet similar the world can be. -->

 <!-- I’ve been to quite a few places (Ecuador, Tanzania, Greece, Israel, South Korea, to name a few). -->

<!-- to promote mutual understanding from cultures . Capture photos to show similarities and differences -->

<!-- But I recently got into portraiture and event photography, perhaps because quite a few student societies I joined needed me to cover for their event (such as 180 consulting, Women in CS, and MathSoc). -->

<!-- I also realized that photography is a great way to document our family life moments since I’m spending so much time away from my family in university.  -->

<!-- ![A photo of mom and sister](/assets/img/aboutme/mom_n_sis.jpg) -->

<!-- When I'm not coding or doing any of the above, you could find me sailing, kayaking, swimming, camping, hiking, skiing, skating, running, doing yoga, playing ultimate frisbee, playing basketball, playing badminton, drawing, playing clarinet, and more. I've dabbled in quite a few sports and I challenge you to find something that I haven't tried! -->
