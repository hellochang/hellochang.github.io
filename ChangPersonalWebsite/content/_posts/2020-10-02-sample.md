Sample
======

Sample Definitions
------------------

A **sample** *S* is a subset of the population. A sample has
*n* &lt;  &lt; *N* units.  
An sample attribute *a*(𝒮) is an **estimate** of the population
attribute *a*(𝒫)  
$$ a(\\mathcal S) = \\widehat{a(\\mathcal P)} = a(\\hat{\\mathcal  P})$$
**Sample error** is the difference between the sample estimate *a*(𝒮)
and the population attribute *a*(𝒫) (the **estimand**). For numerical
attributes , sample error is determined mathematically. For graphical
attributes, sample error is not determined precisely but it is still
conceptually applicable.
*e**r**r**o**r* = *a*(𝒮) − *a*(𝒫)
**Fisher consistency** happens if the sample 𝒮 is equal to the
population 𝒫 so the sample error is zero, meaning the estimation is
sometimes consistent.

All Possible Samples Definitions
--------------------------------

For a population 𝒫 of size *N* and a sample 𝒮 of size *n*, there is
${N \\choose n}$ possible samples 𝒮 with size *n*.

Gernerating All Possible Samples
--------------------------------

Use the R function *combn(…)* to generate all of the possible samples of
size *n* from a population of size *N*

#### Example 1

For instance, the following example gives all subsets of size 3 from
population of {*A*, *B*, *C*, *D*, *E*}

    combn(LETTERS[1:5],3)

    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
    ## [1,] "A"  "A"  "A"  "A"  "A"  "A"  "B"  "B"  "B"  "C"  
    ## [2,] "B"  "B"  "B"  "C"  "C"  "D"  "C"  "C"  "D"  "D"  
    ## [3,] "C"  "D"  "E"  "D"  "E"  "E"  "D"  "E"  "E"  "E"

#### Example 2

    samples <-combn(Australia,5)
    M <-ncol(samples)
    head(knitr::kable(data.frame(first = samples[,1],second = samples[,2],
                                 third = samples[,3],fourth = samples[,4],
                                 fifth = samples[,5],last = samples[, M])))

    ## [1] "first   second   third   fourth   fifth   last "
    ## [2] "------  -------  ------  -------  ------  -----"
    ## [3] "1       1        1       1        1       54   "
    ## [4] "6       6        6       6        6       55   "
    ## [5] "7       7        7       7        7       58   "
    ## [6] "9       9        9       9        9       59   "

    print(M)

    ## [1] 98280

A Population of Attributes
--------------------------

We can calculate any attribute for all of the possible samples of a
population.

    avesSamp <-apply(samples,MARGIN =2,FUN =function(s) 
      {mean(sharks[s,"Length"])})

We could also plot the results using a histogram.

Sample error
------------

Sample error is calculated as the following
$$a(\\mathcal S)- a(\\mathcal  P) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\_{y\\in\\mathcal{S}}y\_u - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\_{y\\in\\mathcal{P}}y\_u$$
If we want to calculate the sample error using R, the following is how
we approach it:

    sampleErrors <-avesSamp-avePop

Consistency
-----------

Sample error depends on sample size:

-   The sample approaches the population as the the sample size
    increases

-   Attributes concentrate more around the population value as the the
    sample size increases

The consistency for an attribute is shown by the concentration around
the true population value in the sample. We use the absolute difference
between the sample attribute and the population attribute to quantify
this concentration,
$$\\lvert a(\\mathcal S) -a(\\mathcal P) \\rvert = \\lvert \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\_{y\\in\\mathcal{S}}y\_u - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\_{y\\in\\mathcal{P}}y\_u \\rvert 
&lt; c$$
