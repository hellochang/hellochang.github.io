<!-- ## Image Recognition for Handwritten digits
Skills: *R, RMarkdown*

Just another small project for recognizing handwritten digits. -->

<!-- ## Credit Card Approval Predictor
Skills: *Python, Data manipulation (Pandas, Numpy), Data Visualization(Matplotlib), Machine Learning (scikit-learn)*

It's common for university students to apply for credit cards, and it's time for me to get a credit card too! I built a model to try to predict if my credit card would be approved based on data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

I cleaned and preprocessed the data by scaling and label encoding, imputed missing values with the most frequent values, etc. Next, I fitted the data with logistic regression using sklearn and used grid search to optimize the model. My model was able to predict credit card approval with 87% of accuracy in the end, which is decent. 

For fun, I applied my model on my personal data. Yes! My credit card would be approved based on my model predication. When I actually tried to apply for credit card in real life, I indeed received a credit card! -->

<!-- ## Surviving the Titanic
Skills: *Python, Data Visualization(Seaborn), Machine Learning (scikit-learn)*

To find the key elements that affect survival on ship wreck, I analysed data from the Titanic ship crash to receive some insights. I first performed exploratory data analysis on the titanic dataset to have a basic understanding of the data. Then, I graphed the importance of features and created beautiful visualizations with Seaborn. 

I applied various sklearn algorithms (logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest, SVM) to compare model performance, and found a suitable model with more than 80% of accuracy. To improve my model performance, I performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. I was able to optimized the model and increased model accuracy to 85% in the end! -->


## Towards Smaller Diffusion Models - Gaussian Mixture Masks and UNet Scaling
*#Diffusion Models #Deep Learning #Research*

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated superior image generation capabilities but suffer from slow inference and high computational costs. As a first step to address these challenges, we propose two novel modifications to enhance small-scale diffusion models- Gaussian mixture masks and scaled skip connections. More details in the [report](../assets/projects/gmm_report.pdf) or [poster](../assets/projects/gmm_poster.pdf).

## Classify New Stars 
#R #Research #EDA #Variable Selection #Machine Learning

Photography has always been one of my passions. For our project for STAT 441 Statistical Learning â€“ Classification, we brought our passion for photography together with statistics and used NASA's astrophotography data to classify new stellar observations.
